# TimeTeller
------------

This project is for the XP Days Ukraine 2017 conference, and represents the first state of code for the "Improving Your Organization’s Technical Prowess With Legacy Code Retreats" talk.

Please do not judge me on this code alone. ☺ 

This code is designed to be an example of legacy code that works, but is nothing that we are proud of and pretty hard to maintain.

#### The goal at this point is to:
* So, we finally have "the code where we want it" and can start some refactoring.  How about some simple ones from method extraction first?
* Notice that TimeTeller has actually grown in number of lines.  But this is because we're extracting methods and making many more small pieces of code rather than one large blob of code.
* I know.  There are OO related refactorings that really, really, should be done.  Let's do that next.
